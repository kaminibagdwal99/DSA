"""You are given a string s which contains only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*'.

Return true if s is valid, otherwise return false.

A string is valid if it follows all of the following rules:

Every left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Every right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
A '*' could be treated as a right parenthesis ')' character or a left parenthesis '(' character, or as an empty string "".
Example 1:

Input: s = "((**)"

Output: true
Explanation: One of the '*' could be a ')' and the other could be an empty string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "(((*)"

Output: false
Explanation: The string is not valid because there is an extra '(' at the beginning, regardless of the extra '*'.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
