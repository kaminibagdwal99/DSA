"""You are given a 2D array of integers triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] represents the ith triplet. You are also given an array of integers target = [x, y, z] which is the triplet we want to obtain.

To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets zero or more times:

Choose two different triplets triplets[i] and triplets[j] and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
* E.g. if triplets[i] = [1, 3, 1] and triplets[j] = [2, 1, 2], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(1, 2), max(3, 1), max(1, 2)] = [2, 3, 2].

Return true if it is possible to obtain target as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: triplets = [[1,2,3],[7,1,1]], target = [7,2,3]

Output: true
Explanation:
Choose the first and second triplets, update the second triplet to be [max(1, 7), max(2, 1), max(3, 1)] = [7, 2, 3].

Example 2:

Input: triplets = [[2,5,6],[1,4,4],[5,7,5]], target = [5,4,6]

Output: false"""
