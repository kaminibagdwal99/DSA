"""You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer amount representing a target amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up the exact target amount.
 If it is impossible to make up the amount, return -1.

You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1,5,10], amount = 12

Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 10 + 1 + 1. Note that we do not have to use every kind coin available.

Example 2:

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3

Output: -1
Explanation: The amount of 3 cannot be made up with coins of 2.

Example 3:

Input: coins = [1], amount = 0

Output: 0"""
